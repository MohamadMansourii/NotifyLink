# üöÄ NotifyLink
Receive **PRTG alerts** as Windows notifications across your network with ease.

## üìù About This Project
NotifyLink is a **lightweight C++ application** that allows you to send notifications from **one computer to another** over a network.

### üìå Why Did I Build This?
I use **PRTG** for network monitoring, but I wanted to receive notifications as **Windows notifications** instead of **SMS or email**.  
Not only on **my own computer**, but also on other **network specialists' computers**‚Äînot all users.

For simplicity, I chose to use [SnoreToast](https://github.com/KDE/snoretoast) instead of the [Windows API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/), as the latter was too bulky.

This repository contains **two main applications**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **`NotificationReceiver` (Client-side)**
   - Runs on network clients.
   - Listens for messages from the server.
   - Displays received messages as Windows notifications.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **`NotificationSender` (Server-side)**
   - Runs on the PRTG server or any computer monitoring the network.
   - Sends alerts to all connected clients when an issue is detected.
   - Receives parameters from PRTG and forwards them to clients.
